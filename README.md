This is a script with some programs I like to install after a fresh Windows installation.

1. Run script_allower.cmd first to let Windows run PowerShell scripts.
2. Run vexan_installers.ps1 with PowerShell.
3. Write the number of the selected program you want to install.
4. Proceed with installation and repeat for the remaining programs you want to install.
5. Exit, run script_allower.cmd again and turn off scripts.
